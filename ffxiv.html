<h1>The best FFXIV jobs of all time according to Floyd</h1>
<h2>As such, it is just an opinion</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Warrior</h3>
<p>Simple to get into an effective. Manly class that allows you to feel powerful as well as be powerful as a tank with giant axe. Great self heals and damage as of 6.5.</p>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<p>Not as simple as the Warrior, it still brings a strong degree of manliness and power in form of a dps. Hand to hand combat is it specialty and your ability to maintain a constent high APM is constantly placed to the test.</p>
<h3>Gunbreaker</h3>
<p>Also a tank just like the Warrior, but focuses more on style just as much as it does substance. Explosive in it's presentation and damage and does an amazing job and making you feel cool.</p>
